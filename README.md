# Control Button Board LV2 Plugin

## Overview

The Control Button Board LV2 Plugin is a custom plugin designed to handle multiple pairs of toggle switches with associated control voltage (CV) outputs. This plugin is designed specifically for use with MOD Devices, allowing users to control effect toggle switches with an external MIDI controller (for instance) as well as a hardware button at the same time. *Currently only tested on a MOD Duo X.*

## Features

- Five pairs of toggle switches.
- Each toggle pair controls a CV output.
- Integrated support for LED indicators on the MOD Device if one or both of the toggle switches are mapped to the hardware button.
- Toggle states can be changed through host control input port change requests.
- Bypass functionality for easy switching.
